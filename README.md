# apt-cacher-ng

[![ci](https://github.com/darkorb/apt-cacher-ng/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/darkorb/apt-cacher-ng/actions/workflows/build-docker.yml)

This was copied over from [sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng) mostly for my own use as that one hasn't updated in a fair while and has some Ubuntu patches that it's missing, but it's a really nice way of having done things.

This one is managed via Whitesource Renovate so should be kept up-to-date automatically as patches come out to the base Ubuntu image.
