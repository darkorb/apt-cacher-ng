# apt-cacher-ng

This was copied over from sameersbn/docker-apt-cacher-ng mostly for my own use as that one hasn't updated in a fair while and has some Ubuntu patches that it's missing, but it's a really nice way of having done things.

This one is managed via Whitesource Renovate so should be kept up-to-date automatically as patches come out to the base image.
